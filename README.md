# DecoratorTagsSpring
This is a project me and my groupmates created for laboratory work at university
### Functionality
- Run `"Main.java"` 
- Input a path to the file with your `Java` code
- The program will create an `.html` copy of your code so it can be seen in a browser
- Open `result.html` file via any browser
